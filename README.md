## Basic Design

The user interacts with a GUI to purchase a ticket / reservation for a train ride, either a specific trip, or to use a specific number of miles within a set number of days.
With program completion, the user will be able to either create an account, or sign in with an existing one to complete their transaction and view past and current transactions.

## How to Install

This project uses maven as a dependency tracker, and as a result needs to be imported into Eclipse as an existing maven project.
After the repo is cloned to a local system, open Eclipse, go to... 
File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Project > wherever you cloned the repo > open project files > make sure the pom.xml is selected > click finish.

## How to execute

If you have followed the steps above, you *should* just need to open up the main method, and click on the green run button.
